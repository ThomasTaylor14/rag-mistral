Examples of such ancillary features include filters on online marketplaces or social networks that allow users to preview products or modify images, as these are tied to the primary service (e.g., purchasing a product or sharing content).\\n\\nAdditionally, the context highlights that certain biometric categorisation systems, such as those inferring sensitive attributes like political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation, are prohibited under the regulation.'"
